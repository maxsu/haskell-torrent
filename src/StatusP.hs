-- | The status code runs a Status Process. This process keeps track
--   of a number of interval valies for a given torrent file and it
--   periodically updates the tracker process with the relevant
--   information about data uploaded, downloaded and how much is
--   left. The tracker is then responsible for using this data
--   correctly to tell the tracker what to do
