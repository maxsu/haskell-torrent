-- | The TrackerP module is responsible for keeping in touch with the Tracker of a torrent.
--   The tracker is contacted periodically, and we exchange information with it. Specifically,
--   we tell the tracker how much we have downloaded, uploaded and what is left. We also
--   tell it about our current state (i.e., are we a seeder or a leecher?).
--
--   The tracker responds to us with a new set of Peers and general information about the
--   torrent in question. It may also respond with an error in which case we should present
--   it to the user.
--
--   TODO List: HTTP Client requests.

-- | The tracker state is used to tell the tracker our current state. In order

--   version below. This may be wrong to do in the long run, but for now it works
--   fine.
--
--   The state is either started or stopped upon the client starting. The
--   tracker will create an entry for us if we tell it that we started, and it
--   will tear down this entry if we tell it that we stopped. It will know if
--   we are a seeder or a leecher based on how much data is left for us to
--   download.
--
--   the 'Completed' entry is used once in the lifetime of a torrent. It
--   explains to the tracker that we completed the torrent in question.
